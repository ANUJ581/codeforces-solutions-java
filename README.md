# Codeforces Solutions Java

And some other stuff, in Java as well. 

I discovered this code on my old hard drive and didn't want to delete it. It was created in 2012-2013 and still seems useful. 

Even though this repository is called "codeforces-solutions-java", it's not only codeforces solutions, but also some other stuff, such as:

- Code from the Algorithms course at coursera
- Code from the Discrete Optimization course at coursera 
- Some other stuff I don't remember
